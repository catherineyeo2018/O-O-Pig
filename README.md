# O-O-Pig
A user plays O-O Pig, a folk jeopardy dice game, against a simulator. The rules of the game are:

"Two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 ("pig") is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:
- roll - If the player rolls a
- 1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
- 2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
- hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn."
